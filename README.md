# Gen-Z Micro Development Kit (uDK) Information  

Welcome to the opensource project which uses Gen-Z micro-development kit as a standalong hardware platform for development of eco-system around Gen-Z device.
Gen-Z micro-development kit also called **uDK** (where u is symbol Mu for micro)  
Software eco-system around Gen-Z is still in development, and there are plenty of ways you can contribute to the existing infrastructure. To start with Gen-Z micro-development kit, you may start looking at [Known_Bugs_and_Limitations] to help fix limitations and known bugs.  

- Instructions on how to use this kit are available in [Release_Notes]   
- Credentials for uDK superuser (Username: root, Password: root)
- You can also find Product Brochure and datasheets at [ZMM] website
